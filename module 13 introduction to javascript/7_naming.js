0. key should be in small letter and it's case sensitive:

var name="john" //var in small letter allowed
Var name="john" //not allowed because "Var" is not a keyword.
VAR name="john" // also not allowed for same reason

1. can't use reserved keyword in variable name like:

var false=45; 
 //false is a reserved keyword and you can't use   reserved keyword in variable name.

 var var=50; //var is also a reserved keyword

      var is happy=false;  
         var ishappy=false; //it is allowed
