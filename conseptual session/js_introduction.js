****************What is JS*************

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is commonly used for web development.
It is a versatile language that can be used for both front-end and back-end development, and it is supported by all major web browsers.

1. hight level means that it is easy to read and write, similar to human language.
It is interpreted, meaning that it is executed line by line by the browser, rather than being compiled into machine code before execution.
such as Python or JavaScript

2. low level languages are closer to machine code, such as C or Assembly language.
low level languages are more difficult to read and write, but they can be more efficient in terms of performance.

3.there are two types of programming languages:
- compiled and interpreted.

************and there's also a third type, which is a hybrid of the two.hybrid languages combine the features of both compiled and interpreted languages.works like a compiled language, but it is executed by an interpreter rather than being compiled into machine code before execution.such as Java or C#, kotlin, or Swift.

************compiled languages are converted into machine code [ 0, 1] before execution, while interpreted languages are executed line by line by the interpreter.

************interpreted languages code is executed by the browser, which means that it is executed line by line, rather than being compiled into machine code before execution.


4. javascript runs on engine called V8, which is a JavaScript engine developed by Google for use in the Chrome web browser and Node.js.
V8 is an open-source project that compiles JavaScript code into machine code at runtime, allowing for faster execution of JavaScript code.

5. JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning that it can only execute one task at a time.
However, it can handle asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax, allowing it to perform non-blocking operations.

6. JavaScript is an event-driven language, meaning that it can respond to user interactions and other events in real-time.
This allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications that can respond to user input without requiring a page reload.

7.we can run js from node.js, which is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
Node.js allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side, enabling the creation of scalable and high-performance web applications.    
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications.

8. JavaScript is a prototype-based language, meaning that it uses prototypes to create objects and inheritance.
This allows for more flexible and dynamic object-oriented programming compared to class-based languages like Java or C#.
