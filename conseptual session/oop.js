Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript:
OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects to represent data and methods. JavaScript supports OOP through prototypes and classes.

1. Objects: Objects are collections of key-value pairs, where keys are properties and values can be any data type, including functions (methods).

2. Prototypes: Every JavaScript object has a prototype, which is another object from which it can inherit properties and methods.

3. Classes: ES6 introduced classes, which are syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance.

4. Inheritance: JavaScript supports inheritance, allowing one class to inherit properties and methods from another class.

5. Encapsulation: OOP allows bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (object).

6. Polymorphism: OOP allows methods to be defined in a way that they can operate on different types of objects.

7. Abstraction: OOP allows hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts of an object.
